# Identity Operators
# Same value always store same address where variable name is different

# Check addresh same for (first-variable-name  is second-variable-name ) 
# like a,b are variable then (a is b)
a=5
b=5
print(a is b)
print(a is not b)

# Check address for not same (a is not b )

x=10
y=11
print(x is y)
print(x is not y)
